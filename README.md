###### :moneybag:The idea of this application is simple; to keep track of prices in Amazon for users to time purchasing windows in order to generate more savings.

###### :thumbsdown: I am in constant exposure to news forecasting the rise in the cost of living, how the markets are in turmoil. In order to help alleviate this just even fractionally I wanted to bring my technical background into play where I could help.

###### :chart_with_upwards_trend: By using technologies to scrape the web, I hope to keep track of Amazon's historical prices for items that users may need/want in order to allow them to find the right purchasing window.
